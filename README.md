OSM that you can access while you’re offline.

# How it works
While online, individual map tiles from the OSM server are stored inside your browser. When you’re offline, the app is still accessible via PWA and shows all previously downloaded map tiles stored in your browser.

----

Use the “manage tiles” button (or right-click / long-press on a coordinate point) to manage all downloaded map tiles. You can update or delete a specific map tile.
